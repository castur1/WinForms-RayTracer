Hi there? I don't really know how GitHub works but whatever, it's probably fine. This is basically an implementation of 
Ray Tracing in One Weekend (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in Windows Forms. It's slow
and could probably use some refactoring, but hey, at least it works. That's basically it, really. Yeah.
